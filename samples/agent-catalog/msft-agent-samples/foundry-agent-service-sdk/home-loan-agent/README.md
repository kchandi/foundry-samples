  Add a custom tool or connector (e.g., via Azure Logic Apps) to allow users to submit pre-approval applications, upload documents, or retrieve loan status from internal LOS platforms.

- **Personalize Based on User Profile**  
  Modify the `system_message` to adjust tone and guidance for first-time buyers, military veterans, or investment property seekers.

- **Enable Secure Document Submission**  
  Extend the agent to support Azure Blob or SharePoint uploads for income verification, ID, or bank statements, and validate them using metadata or form templates.

- **Visualize Loan Comparisons**  
  Generate charts comparing monthly payments, total interest, and amortization curves across loan products.

- **Add Multi-language Support**  
  Integrate Translator or prompt-based language switching to support users in multiple languages.
