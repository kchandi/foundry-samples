# Travel Planner Agent

This code sample enables creating an agent to help users receive up-to-date travel recommendations by leveraging both the **Bing Grounding Tool** and the **TripAdvisor API**. The agent summarizes relevant information clearly and offers to create a custom itinerary based on the user's travel duration.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Starter templates, instructions, code samples and resources in this msft-agent-samples file (‚Äúsamples‚Äù) are designed to assist in accelerating development of agents for specific scenarios. It is important that you review all provided resources and carefully test Agent behavior in the context of your use case: ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/agents/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fagents%2Fcontext%2Fcontext)). 

Certain Agent offerings may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements, may require licenses, or may not be suitable for all industries, scenarios, or use cases.‚ÄØBy using any sample, you are acknowledging that Agents or other output created using that sample are solely your responsibility, and that you will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and relevant safety standards, terms of service, and codes of conduct.  

## Use Cases
1. **Vacation Planning**: Travelers can get up-to-date suggestions on destinations, hotels, and activities.
2. **Business Travel**: Professionals receive efficient recommendations tailored to time-sensitive trips.
3. **Local Exploration**: Residents or tourists can find trending events, attractions, or day-trip ideas in their vicinity.

## Architecture Overview
The system consists of:
- An AI Agent created with Azure AI Agent Service using `gpt-4o` as the base model.
- A Bing Grounding Tool integrated via Azure Bing Account and connected to the agent.
- A TripAdvisor API tool integrated via OpenAPI.
- A Bicep template to automate provisioning of Azure resources.
