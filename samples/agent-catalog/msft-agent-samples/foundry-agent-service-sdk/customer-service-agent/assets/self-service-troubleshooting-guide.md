## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Check Your Internet Connection**
   - Ensure your device is connected to the internet. Activation requires a stable connection.
   - If using Wi-Fi, try switching to a wired connection for better stability.

### 2. **Verify Your Product Key**
   - Double-check the product key you entered. Ensure there are no typos.
   - If you purchased Windows online, confirm the key from your purchase confirmation email.

### 3. **Run the Activation Troubleshooter**
   - Open **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Activation**.
   - Click **Troubleshoot** to let Windows diagnose and fix activation issues automatically.

### 4. **Check for Windows Updates**
   - Open **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Update**.
   - Click **Check for updates** and install any pending updates. Activation issues can sometimes be resolved by updating your system.

### 5. **Ensure the Product Key Matches Your Windows Version**
   - Confirm that your product key is for the correct edition of Windows (e.g., Home, Pro, Enterprise).
   - Mismatched keys will not activate the system.

### 6. **Reactivate After Hardware Changes**
   - If you recently changed hardware (e.g., motherboard), you may need to reactivate Windows.
   - Open **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Activation** and select **Troubleshoot**.
   - Sign in with your Microsoft account to reactivate.

### 7. **Contact Microsoft Support**
   - If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact Microsoft Support for assistance.
   - Visit [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com) or call the support number for your region.
